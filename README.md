# Frontend Challenge - Advice generator app

![Design preview for the Advice generator app coding challenge](https://www.figma.com/file/LcteLYZ7VA0ONPoBKSDAHe/Advice-UI)

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking and working as close to the design as possible. Aspects of this challenge range in difficulty.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size. Please ensure a responsive design for screens from 375px - 1440px.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See animations for state transitions
- Generate a new and random piece of advice by clicking the circular dice icon button

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs visible here: https://www.figma.com/file/LcteLYZ7VA0ONPoBKSDAHe/Advice-UI. You will need to create a Figma account in order to fully use the inspect features of Figma. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design, although the desktop prototype is the only one that shows interactions. All interactions on the desktop prototype should be applied to the mobile version.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

## How your work will be evaluated

**You have two goals in this order.**

1. Provide the best user experience to your users. This includes making sure the design and interactions are as close to the mockups as possible. This also includes performance optimization so that your users have the fastest and most compatible website that works on the bulk of web platforms in 2022.

2. Provide the best development experience for you and your team. This includes using modern and flexible development practices, file/folder structure and organization, clean code with comments where necessary, etc.
*(If you run low on time, skimp on this goal and when we review your solution, you can talk about what you would have improved if you had more time)*


## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a list of suggested resources and tips:

1. CSS Animations - https://animate.style/
2. CSS Preprocessor - https://sass-lang.com/
3. Advice Generator API - https://api.advicesls
lip.com
4. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
5. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
6. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
7. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
